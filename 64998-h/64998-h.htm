<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present volume is designed to exhibit
the subject of Practical Phrenology in as clear
and as perspicuous a light as its nature will
admit. To this purpose the author has aimed
to divest it of all extraneous matter, and at
the same time to avoid all unnecessary conciseness.
The learner will here find a comprehensive
view of the functions of each
organ, with their different effects on the character
when in various stages of developement,
and also when compounded with each other.</p>

<p>The author presents few claims to originality.
In a few instances he has even adopted
the language of others where it presented
itself in a felicitous manner&mdash;his aim being
to make a good book rather than to add to his
own reputation.</p>

<p>It is but proper here to state that the work
has passed through the press without the
benefit of the author’s personal inspection&mdash;an
affection of the eyes rendering this service
impossible. But for this it might have received
many <i>retouches</i>, which, if they did
not add materially to its <i>value</i>, might have
improved its appearance.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="amativeness">1. AMATIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ produces the sexual passion, and
imparts to its possessor a desire for the happiness
of the opposite sex. In society it does
much to promote general kindliness of feeling,
and urbanity of manners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;One in whom this organ predominates,
will incline to be libidinous, licentious
and lustful. If his moral organs are very
large, particularly Firmness and Conscientiousness,
he may restrain the outward expression of
this feeling; but it will, nevertheless, be powerful,
and at times overwhelming. If long deprived
of the society of the other sex, he will feel
lonesome and disconsolate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large</span>.&mdash;With large Amativeness and Adhesiveness,
an individual will be exceedingly attached
to the society of the other sex; and
will be capable of readily ingratiating himself
into their favour. If with these organs
large, and small Firmness and Conscientiousness,
although his love will be intense and
fervid, yet he will be apt to be capricious and
fickle in his attachments. He will be inclined
rather to seek the favour of the sex generally,
than to limit his regard to a single object. If
Adhesiveness, Inhabitiveness and Philoprogenitiveness
are large, he will be induced to marry
early, but if Adhesiveness, Philoprogenitiveness,
and Conscientiousness are small, he will be
inclined to gratify this feeling without reference
to the laws of morality. With Self-esteem,
Firmness, and Secretiveness large, although he
may love intensely, yet he will not allow his passion
to predominate over him; if disappointed, he
will not be subdued, but manifest to the spectator
the appearance of unconcern. With such
a combination, he will, in all cases, feel much
more intensely than his expressions will imply.
If Mirthfulness is large, and Conscientiousness
and Ideality small, he will be liable to joke, and
be fond of licentious allusions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With a moderate developement
of this organ, an individual will take great pleasure
in the society of ladies, whose taste and
feelings coincide with his own. If his Moral
Sentiments and Intellect are large, he will be
averse to the society of the merely volatile and
frivolous. If Ideality and Love of Approbation
are large, he will be attracted by the company
of the gay and fashionable. If Ideality and
Intellect generally, are large, he will be disgusted
with vulgarity and libidinous allusions.
His passion will be deep, but not lasting, and
with a moderate amount of controlling organs he
can restrain it at will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;When this organ is small, an individual
will be distant and reserved towards
females. If Adhesiveness is large, he may be
attached to the society of a select few; but the
connexion will be of a strictly Platonic character.
He will be unable to feel the peculiar
pleasures of female society. If Adhesiveness
and Philoprogenitiveness are large, he may be
disposed to a matrimonial alliance; but if these
organs are small, he will be decidedly averse
to such a connexion. If one with Moral Sentiments
moderate, and Destructiveness and Self-esteem
large, under the influence of the aforementioned
combination, were to marry, the
connexion would be necessarily an unfortunate
one; his attachment could not outlive the
vicissitudes attending the marriage state, and
would inevitably degenerate into disdain and
aversion. He would, notwithstanding, be a
fond parent, though his affection would be
capricious and ill regulated. With Adhesiveness,
Conscientiousness, Veneration, and Benevolence
large, an individual’s regard for the
wife of his choice, if fortunate in his selection,
will increase with time; the strength of his superior
sentiments more than supplying the want
of animal passion.</p>

<h3 id="philoprogenitiveness">2. PHILOPROGENITIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> legitimate office of this organ is to produce
love for one’s own offspring. It produces,
however, in the breast of its possessor an affection
for children indiscriminately; for the feeble
and helpless; for pets&mdash;as dogs, horses, cats, &amp;c.,
and even for inanimate objects. It has an influence
in producing general kindliness of disposition.
A peculiarity of its character consists
in its inspiring its possessor to love with the
fondest affection the child that is the most helpless,
and even the one that has caused the greatest
solicitude and brought down on its parent the
deepest disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;An individual in whom this
organ predominates has a constant hankering
for the society of children. If without them
himself, he views the deprivation as a great misfortune,
and if his circumstances are favourable,
will be likely to adopt one, for the purpose of
exhausting the energy of this feeling upon it.
He will be likewise much attached to pets, as
horses and dogs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;Those who possess this organ large,
betray it in every look and motion when in company
with children. They take the greatest
delight in their society, and enter into their
little troubles and enjoyments with the greatest
zeal. They readily enlist their confidence, and
can easily control them. If deprived of their
society, they will exhaust their attachment upon
some pet animal which they will frequently
fondle. When Combativeness, Destructiveness
and Philoprogenitiveness are large, an individual
will punish children severely when they annoy
him, notwithstanding his great affection for
them. If Self-esteem and Combativeness are
small, he will be liable to humour his children
and allow them improper indulgences. With
Combativeness and Destructiveness large, he
will be apt to be capricious in his feelings
towards children, at one time humoring them,
and at another petulant and cross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Philoprogenitiveness moderate,
a person will be attached to his own
children to a good degree, and may take some
interest in others after they begin to lose their
infantile character. This feeling, however, will
not be durable. He will readily tire of children
when they annoy him. The death of a child
will be a poignant affliction to him, but it
will be soon forgotten. If Destructiveness and
Self-esteem are large, he will be liable to punish
them with severity for trivial offences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With this organ small, a person will
be exceedingly annoyed by children. If a parent,
he will consign the care of them to menials. In
all his intercourse with company, he will betray
a marked indifference to their society. If ever
induced to amuse them, his awkwardness will
betray itself to the most casual observer. If
Benevolence is large, he will take all needful
care of them; but if Secretiveness and Destructiveness
are large, he will delight to torment and
teaze them.</p>

<h3 id="adhesiveness">3. ADHESIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ furnishes the instinct of social
attachment. Towards the object of its regard
it excites the purest feelings of affection. It is
not satisfied with loving, it must also be loved,
and requires for its healthy existence a constant
exchange of pure and radiant affection. It diffuses
its influence over the whole character of
the man, and tends to render him kind, amiable,
and affectionate. It leads to the love of company,
and of social intercourse. While it is the
germ of many virtues, it is to be feared; in the
present state of society, it is likewise productive
of many vices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Adhesiveness predominant,
an individual is pre-eminently qualified
to enjoy friendship, and will be miserable without
it. He will often feel the yearnings of
affection coming over him with all the intensity
of a passion. His most vivid enjoyments are
experienced in the society of his friends. He
readily recognises the existence of a similar
feeling in another, and, if circumstances are
favourable, they soon become intimate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;One having Adhesiveness large, is
eminently social and affectionate. With large
Moral organs, will make great sacrifices to render
his friends service, and will esteem the
pleasures of friendship as one of the chief sources
of enjoyment. With Combativeness and Destructiveness
large, and Self-esteem moderate,
will resent an aggression upon a friend which
he would not notice upon himself. If Self-esteem
is large, with Combativeness and Destructiveness
large, he will easily get angry with his
friends, but will be readily conciliated. With
Benevolence and Love of Approbation large, is
exceedingly liberal and forward among friends;
will do his utmost to please and gratify them;
earnestly desire their approbation; and will be
exceedingly sensitive to their reproaches. With
Firmness and Conscientiousness small, will be
capricious in his attachments. With Secretiveness
and Self-esteem large, he will not fully
express the feelings which he experiences, and
will thus leave the impression that his affection
is less than it really is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;One having Adhesiveness moderate,
may be strongly attached to friends, but
his friendships will be readily severed. He
may be companionable, and with large Benevolence
will be generous and good-hearted, but he
will still lack that strong feeling of sympathy
without which friendship is but a name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Adhesiveness small, an individual
will be unsocial, cold-hearted and selfish.
If his moral organs predominate over self-esteem,
he may be companionable, but he will be nearly
wanting in the attributes of character ascribed to
this organ.</p>

<h3 id="inhabitiveness">4. INHABITIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ produces home-sickness, and causes
a feeling of regret to take possession of the mind
when leaving a place in which one has long
resided. It is the first element of patriotism.
It produces a desire to locate and reside in a
particular place, and adds much to the strength
of family attachments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;One in whom Inhabitiveness
predominates, is pre-eminently attached to any
place with which he has become familiar. It
causes him much pain to leave it, and he returns
to it with eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;One having inhabitiveness large, will
experience the most poignant sensations of regret
at leaving a place with which he has become
familiar. Even a particular house, garden, office
or room, has for him peculiar gratifications.
With large Locality, will take delight in travelling,
but will be constantly harassed by
thoughts of home. This is more especially
the case if Concentrativeness is large. If Self-esteem
and Veneration are large, he will be
eminently patriotic, and will defend his country
from aspersions with as much vigour as himself.
Veneration being large, he will experience the
profoundest feelings of respect and regard for
the memory of the departed worthies of its history;
and with large Individuality, Eventuality,
&amp;c., he will take great delight in reading the
history of his own country, and of conversing
upon its character and institutions. If long
absent from home, he is constantly curious, and
eagerly seeks every means of being informed
concerning it. The peculiarities of the different
places in which he has resided often occur to him
with feelings of the most vivid pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;One in whom Inhabitiveness is
moderate, will not change his residence without
regret, yet soon becomes reconciled to a new
location. If long absent from his country, Self-esteem
being small, he will become expatriated
in feeling, and identify himself wholly with the
country in which he resides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;When Inhabitiveness is small, the
individual will be constantly prompted to change
his place of residence. Unless this feeling is
counteracted by the strength of other organs, he
cannot get familiarized with a place without
becoming dissatisfied and restless.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3 id="concentrativeness">5. CONCENTRATIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ imparts the power of continuity of
thought. It also aids in enabling its possessor
to continue the action of the organs generally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;One having Concentrativeness
predominant, with Causality large, will be much
subject to absence of mind. He will be quite
unable to attend to more than one thing at a
time, and will be generally prolix in conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With large Concentrativeness, an
individual will be much disturbed if more than
one thing claim attention at once; has a strong
inclination after taking up a subject to pursue it
till he has completed it. In conversation he
will be much distracted if it is desultory in its
character. If a writer, his compositions will
exhibit a sustained unity of expression throughout.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;One with Concentrativeness moderate,
is inclined to pursue a subject or train of
thought, but can be easily diverted from it. If
Causality and Intellect generally are moderate,
is neither inclined to pursue a study to its
termination, nor is he able to pass rapidly to
another. With nervous temperament he will
possess great versatility of attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Concentrativeness small, an
individual will be quite unable to devote his
attention for any length of time to a single study
or subject. In ordinary conversation, he will
fly from one subject to another, without order or
arrangement. His friends, even if strongly
attached to them, will not be long thought of at
a time. His antipathies will be readily assuaged.
He will possess great vivacity of disposition.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="selfish-propensities">SELFISH PROPENSITIES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="combativeness">1. COMBATIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ gives the desire to oppose, resist
and overcome. It renders its possessor able
to encounter difficulties, and to be bold and
strenuous in his opposition. If not properly
regulated, it leads to a desire to contradict and
quarrel for the sake of opposition. It gives
vigour and zeal to the pugilist and warrior.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;When this organ predominates,
the individual will be bold, disputatious
and quarrelsome. In an encounter he will never
be satisfied till he has obtained the mastery.
He will display great nerve and determination
in whatever he undertakes. With Self-esteem
large, and Conscientiousness and Benevolence
small, he will be extremely quarrelsome and
overbearing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Self-esteem large, the individual
will be pre-eminently bold and enterprising.
If Firmness is small, he will be wavering in
his views; but if Firmness is large, he will add
perseverance to courage, and never give up
a point while a reasonable hope of success remains.
If with this combination, and Moral
Sentiments small, he will be litigious and quarrelsome.
If Destructiveness is small, he will be
fond of disputing, but will avoid giving pain.
If Destructiveness is large, and Benevolence
small, he will be vindictive and cruel, and will
ever be disposed to vindicate his own importance,
regardless of circumstances or the rights of
others. If Love of Approbation, Benevolence,
Veneration and Conscientiousness are large,
he will avoid all low contentions, and will direct
the action of this organ to the maintenance
of right and the enforcement of just opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;One with moderate Combativeness,
will forbear in a contention as long as
Self-esteem will allow. If his temperament is
active, he may be irritable and passionate, but
upon the whole, will be peaceable. If his religious
feelings are strong, notwithstanding his
usual distaste for opposition, he will contend
strenuously for the rights of his church, and
cheerfully encounter reproach for its sake. If
Acquisitiveness is large, and Self-esteem small,
he will allow himself to be insulted with impunity,
but will resist every attack upon his property.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Combativeness small, an individual’s
character will be mild and peaceable.
He will rather submit to oppression than make
the requisite exertion to defend his rights.
Above every thing else he will desire peace.
With Self-esteem small, he will be eminently
deficient in presence of mind in times of danger.
He will quail under opposition, and with Cautiousness
large, will be timid and cowardly.
With Destructiveness large, and Benevolence
small, he will be harsh and severe where there
is no resentment to be feared. With Acquisitiveness
large, he will be fond of acquiring by
slow accumulations, rather than by bold speculations.
With Domestic Feelings large, he will
avoid the turbulent scenes of life, and seek
refuge in quiet and retirement.</p>

<h3 id="destructiveness">2. DESTRUCTIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ produces the propensity to exterminate
and destroy. It incites the murderer
to his act of crime. It renders its possessor
harsh, cruel, and indifferent to the feelings of
others, and is an active element in the minds of
all warriors, sportsmen and pugilists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Destructiveness predominant,
an individual will be harsh, cruel and
severe. His language will abound with pungent
sarcasms and cutting remarks. With large
Combativeness, he will prefer arms as a profession.
With Self-esteem and Combativeness
both large, he will be distinguished for his
energy and force of character. He will drive
through his purposes regardless of opposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Destructiveness large, and Benevolence
small, an individual will be cruel,
sanguinary and severe. With Secretiveness and
Conscientiousness small, and Combativeness and
Self-esteem large, he will be exceedingly passionate
and vindictive. With such a combination,
he will lose no opportunity of assailing the
feelings of his opponents. If Amativeness and
Adhesiveness are large, he will be attached to
his family, yet will treat them often with great
severity. If Combativeness and Destructiveness
are small, it will require much to excite
him, but when aroused, he will be vindictive to
the last degree. If Benevolence is large, he will
not be sanguinary or cruel; but with Combativeness
moderate, will be mild and amiable in
disposition, yet capable of great severity when
circumstances justify it. This combination
enables the surgeon to perform an operation
with the requisite energy, and yet without giving
unnecessary pain. With Approbativeness
small, and Self-esteem, Conscientiousness and
Benevolence large, he may be charitable, yet he
will often give needless offence in his administrations
of charity. He will destroy every thing
that is not absolutely valuable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Destructiveness moderate,
and Benevolence large, one will be tender-hearted,
and with small Combativeness, effeminate.
With moderate Benevolence, and large
Self-esteem and Combativeness, he will possess
sufficient severity of character to enable him to
succeed in any lawful occupation. He will be
naturally peaceful and opposed to harsh measures
when they can be avoided, yet will not
refrain from using severity when necessary. If
Benevolence is large, and Combativeness and
Self-esteem moderate, he will lack energy and
force of mind; will easily sink under difficulties
and submit quietly to aggression and imposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Destructiveness small, an individual
will be effeminate, and with moderate
Combativeness, be very destitute of energy and
force of character. He will be mild, inoffensive,
and peaceable. The performance of an action
that requires the infliction of much pain, will be
to him nearly impossible. With Acquisitiveness
moderate or large, he will have a desire to
preserve and lay by every thing that is not absolutely
worthless. It will give him pain to see
any thing that may possibly be of service destroyed.</p>

<h3 id="secretiveness">3. SECRETIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ gives the desire and the talents for
concealment. In its abuse, it renders its possessor
averse to, and almost incapable of, an
open-hearted expression. His remarks are sly,
evasive and ambiguous. His actions, he considers,
are beyond the reach of human sagacity.
It is the foundation of all hypocrisy, deception
and intrigue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;One in whom Secretiveness
predominates, will be sly, conniving and hypocritical.
It will be difficult for him to relate the
simplest incident without evasion. If he has an
end to bring about, he will seek to do it by
some manœuvre, even when an open course
would be more effective. The most trifling
actions of his life will be brought about by stratagem.
He looks upon others as being actuated
by the same motives as himself, and is
constantly suspicious and watchful. He will
possess great tact, and be readily enabled to discover
the motives of others. In conversation, he
is apt to hesitate and recommence his sentences,
and to answer in an ambiguous manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Secretiveness, Self-esteem and
Conscientiousness large, an individual will detest
hypocrisy and duplicity, yet will be exceedingly
prudent and circumspect in his conversation
and conduct. He will be slow to make
acquaintances, and will require a long time ere
he becomes intimate with them. With Love of
Approbation large, he will be deferential and
polite, and will possess a superior tact at making
himself agreeable. With Comparison and Individuality
large, he will possess a good knowledge
of human nature, will be well qualified to
detect intrigue, and of frustrating any designs
upon himself. If Self-esteem, Firmness and
Secretiveness are large, he will endure pain
with the most heroic fortitude and forbearance.
If Conscientiousness be moderate, he will be
very suspicious towards others, and will be perpetually
on his guard. If Destructiveness and
Self-esteem are large, he will be easily made
angry, but with Cautiousness and Firmness
large, will restrain his feelings even when highly
excited. With Conscientiousness and Cautiousness
large, it will be exceedingly difficult for
him to form an opinion. With Adhesiveness
moderate, and Imitation large, he will be liable
to be very friendly to one’s face, and abuse him
in his absence. With Self-esteem and Firmness
large, will seldom yield to an opponent, but
will very often deceive him by appearing to have
yielded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Secretiveness moderate,
and Self-esteem large, one will be frank, candid
and open-hearted in his ordinary intercourse
with society, yet will be capable, when necessity
requires it, of intrigue and duplicity. He
will be frank, open and sincere to acquaintances,
yet will manifest much reserve to strangers.
His ordinary conversation will be discreet,
yet, when excited, he will express his sentiments
regardless of consequences; this is more particularly
true when Cautiousness is small. He
will then be distinguished for contrariety of
feeling, being prudent and circumspect at one
time, and open, blunt and offending at another.
Conscientiousness being small, adds much to
the strength of Secretiveness. He will then
use deception and intrigue whenever they answer
his purpose. If Self-esteem, Combativeness
and Destructiveness are large, he will be
very blunt and decided, when nothing is to be
gained by an opposite course, and will express
his sentiments without scruple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Secretiveness small, one is
frank, candid and open-hearted. He will freely
relate even to comparative strangers all his
foibles and weaknesses, as well as his virtues
and merits. He expresses his hatred and dislikes
without fear or favour. Strangers will
suppose his anger or displeasure to be greater
than it really is. With Destructiveness and
Self-esteem large, he will get angry readily,
but if Concentrativeness is small, will soon recover
his temper. He will be often imposed
upon in consequence of his relying too much on
others. If Love of Approbation and Benevolence
are small, his demeanour will be usually
gruff and impolite. He will have great
aversion to outside show, will use plain and
blunt expressions, and be fond of forcible language.</p>

<h3 id="acquisitiveness">4. ACQUISITIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ produces the desire to save, to
hoard up and accumulate. It induces its possessor
to acquire property without reference to
its uses or his own necessities. It produces the
instinct of property.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;A person in whom this organ
predominates, will be miserly, sordid and avaricious.
He will look upon the accumulation
of property as the great end of human existence.
If with a low education, he will not scruple to
steal and pilfer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With large Acquisitiveness, and
small Benevolence, an individual will be selfish,
sordid and grasping; but with large Conscientiousness,
he will not trespass on the rights of
others. With Domestic Feelings small, he will
be excessively penurious in regard to his family,
and will begrudge every shilling that is expended
for their benefit; but if Domestic Feelings are
large, he will spend money freely for the comfort
of his family, when he would not on his
own account. With Love of Approbation and
Ideality large, he will spend money freely, in
order that he may excel in dress, equipage, &amp;c.,
while at the same time, he will be excessively
penurious in his dealings. With large Veneration,
he will look with much respect and awe
upon those who are distinguished for their
wealth. With Love of Approbation large, he
will be anxious to avoid the reputation of littleness
in his dealings, and will often give to charitable
objects, but will give in such a way as it
shall be known. With Firmness, Self-esteem,
Hope and Combativeness large, he will be eminently
enterprising and persevering. If Caution
is small, will be apt to rush into speculations
heedlessly and recklessly; but if Caution is large,
will be exceedingly prudent and careful in what
he undertakes; but when he has come to a conclusion
upon a point, he will pursue it with
great zeal and energy. If Secretiveness is
large, he will have great ability to make a bargain
and effect an arrangement where many
others would fail. If Cautiousness is large, and
Hope and Self-esteem moderate or small, he
will be averse to speculations and great enterprises,
and prefer slow processes of accumulation.
If Firmness is small, he will be apt to be
fickle in his undertakings and not pursue them
long enough to obtain his ends. If Conscientiousness
and Veneration be large, he may be
induced to give money to religious purposes.
If Ideality and Veneration are large, he will be
likely to hoard antiquities, medals, &amp;c. With
large Intellect, he will take great pleasure in
accumulating a library. If Ideality and Love
of Approbation are small, he will care little for
the beauty of the binding or the neatness of the
type; but with Ideality large, he will spend
money freely for these luxuries. With Perceptive
organs large, will be a good judge of property,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With moderate Acquisitiveness,
Self-esteem and Love of Approbation, a person
may be close and economical in his dealings, be
shrewd, enterprising and industrious, may make
and accumulate money, but he will often spend
it unnecessarily. With every desire, as he supposes,
to save, yet he will find at the end of
the year that he has expended much that he
might have saved. If Alimentiveness is large,
he will be unable to deny himself the pleasures
of the table. If Adhesiveness is large, he will
spend money freely for the gratification of his
friends. If Benevolence is large, he will give
much to objects of charity. He will look upon
money as the means of enjoyment, and not as
the end of human exertion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;A person in whom Acquisitiveness is
small, will be unable to understand the value
of money, or to take pleasure in its acquisition,
and unless restrained by the influence of the
moral feelings, will be a spendthrift.</p>

<h3 id="alimentiveness">5. ALIMENTIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ imparts the relish for food and
drink. Its activity is increased when the person
is engaged in eating or drinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;One in whom this organ is
predominant, will be greatly addicted to the
pleasures of the table, will eat voraciously, and
will consider gustatory enjoyments one of the
chief pleasures of existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Adhesiveness and Love of Approbation
large, he will be very fond of public
dinners and festive occasions. If to these be
added Ideality large, the pleasures of these
occasions will be heightened in proportion to the
splendour of their appearance. If Acquisitiveness
is large, there will be a continued struggle
in his mind; the one wishing to save money and
the other to indulge in good living: the contest
will be decided by the character of his other
developements and his worldly circumstances.
If Acquisitiveness is small, he will be regardless
of the expense of an entertainment, and will
gratify his appetite without reference to its cost.
With Adhesiveness, Ideality and Approbativeness
large, he will take delight in entertaining
his friends in a sumptuous manner. With Conscientiousness,
Veneration and Benevolence
large, he will often reproach himself for his
extravagance in matters of the table. With
Mirthfulness, Imitation and Secretiveness large,
will be excessively fond of telling stories, and
in “setting the table in a roar.” With Ideality
and Love of Approbation moderate, and Causality
and Self-esteem large, will be fond of
entertaining company, but will despise ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Alimentiveness moderate,
a person is fond of a good diet, but does not
make it a prominent object of his attention.
With Benevolence large, he will cheerfully put
up with meaner fare than he is accustomed to
when necessity requires it. If Acquisitiveness
is large, he will not expend much upon the
pleasures of the palate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Alimentiveness small, an individual
will be quite regardless of what he eats;
will be unable to remember from one day to
another what he has eaten, and usually finds it
difficult to decide at table what dish to take first.
With Destructiveness large, often speaks bitterly
of those who indulge in luxurious living. With
large Love of Approbation and Ideality, will

of his company and the splendour of
the appearance of his table, than of the quality
of the food, &amp;c.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="selfish-sentiments">SELFISH SENTIMENTS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="firmness">1. FIRMNESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tendency of this organ is to give constancy
and perseverance to the other powers,
and aids their activity and force. Its impulses
are sometimes mistaken for will. This, however,
is not correct, as the action of this organ
urges <i>only to a continuance</i> in the same purpose,
the same mode of thinking, and the same
cause of action. It adds force to resolution,
and is the active element in fortitude, perseverance
and endurance. With a strong endowment
of this organ, persons find it difficult to
enter readily into the feelings of others, or to
feel new emotions suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Firmness predominant,
a person will exhibit unyielding pertinacity of
character throughout all the vicissitudes of life.
No misfortune will appal him. His fortitude of
character will enable him to rise superior to
every affliction. Having once commenced a
pursuit, he will never relinquish it till compelled
to do so by the force of circumstances. His
opinions will seldom change, and his whole
appearance and manner will exhibit the man of
firmness and decision. He may be a good master,
but he will be an unwilling servant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With this organ large, a person will
be of an unmovable character, firm in his resolutions,
and constant in his principles. He
attends little to exhortations or examples, his
conduct is uniform, and his exertions may be
calculated on in all the various situations of
life. With Combativeness and Self-esteem
large, he will never relinquish a pursuit while
a hope of success remains, and with but moderate
Cautiousness and Causality, will be deaf to
all remonstrance or advice. With large Benevolence
and Conscientiousness, he will seek for
independence, yet be just and benevolent. An
attack upon his opinions will increase the tenacity
with which he maintains them. With large
Self-esteem, he will be distinguished for presence
of mind in times of danger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Firmness moderate, a person
will continue constant only in those purposes
in which he is aided by the other organs.
If Conscientiousness is large, and the Selfish
Propensities small, he will continue inflexibly
just through all temptations of life. If Acquisitiveness
is large, he will never waver in his
pursuit of riches. If Self-esteem is small, and
Love of Approbation large, he will be entirely
dependent on the will of his associates. It will
be quite impossible for him to have an opinion of
his own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Firmness small, a person cannot
be said to have a will of his own. He will
follow the last impulse he receives, and without
strength to resist, will be an easy instrument of
every one he meets. The actions of his life
will take their character from the other organs,
and he will thus be constant in the gratification
of predominant dispositions. With large Acquisitiveness,
he will be constant in his efforts
to become rich, but he will be unsteady in
the means he employs. With large Benevolence,
Combativeness and Destructiveness, he
will be now all kindness, and anon passionate,
violent and outrageous. With an active temperament,
he will enter on his pursuits with
great avidity, and follow them up with commendable
zeal, until perhaps, near their accomplishment,
and then fly away to something else.
This state of mind is increased by great Cautiousness,
and diminished by large Self-esteem.</p>

<h3 id="self-esteem">2. SELF-ESTEEM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ produces the feeling of individual
personality, or of personal identity. It causes
the feelings of self-love, self-respect, self-complacency.
It imparts to the individual a high
opinion of himself, and of every thing pertaining
or belonging to himself. The most insignificant
object, when in the possession of an individual
with this feeling strong, assumes a value and an
importance, in his own estimation, which nothing
could have given it before. To such a person,
the idea of self is perpetually before him. Let
an idea be suggested, and his first consideration
will be as to how it will affect his own condition.
It gives a cold and repulsive appearance to the
individual, and renders him particularly obnoxious
to others having the same organization.
It renders one averse to submission, and gives
an inclination to assume the lead. When properly
regulated, it adds dignity to the whole
demeanour, and gives a nobleness to the character
which effectually prevents any action of
meanness or servility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With this organ predominant,
an individual will be proud, haughty and supercilious.
Whatever he possesses, he considers
superior to that belonging to any one else. In his
judgment and actions he scorns all advice, and
looks down with contempt on his fellow-men.
He admits no dictation. He never submits to
advice, but assumes the lead on all occasions.
Any thing like familiarity revolts him. His
whole appearance indicates assurance and presumption.
When excited, he is disposed to go
to the greatest extremes. “He will have many
enemies, and will be regardless of the frown or
the favour of men; intractable, domineering,
repulsive, conceited, jealous, austere, he considers
himself nearly infallible.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With this organ large, the individual
is endowed with that degree of self-complacency
which enables him to apply his powers to the
best advantage, in every situation in which he
may be placed. With Combativeness and Firmness
large, and Destructiveness moderate, he is
eminently qualified to sustain himself in any
situation in which he may be placed. With this
organization, he will be bold, energetic, persevering,
and surpassingly independent. No difficulties
will appal him, and no force of circumstances
of an ordinary character, will deter him
from the prosecution of his designs. With large
Conscientiousness, he will be honourable and
high-minded in the extreme. With large Conscientiousness,
Veneration, Ideality, Benevolence
and Causality, he will rather suffer death
than commit a dishonourable action. If Conscientiousness,
Benevolence and Veneration are
deficient, he will be dogmatic, imperious and
haughty, and will be constantly striving for
power, which, when obtained, he invariably
abuses. If an author, with Ideality, Language
and Comparison large, he will write in a sustained
and lofty style, never descending to a
common-place expression. If his Domestic
Feelings are large, with Combativeness and
Destructiveness large, he will be tenderly attached
to his family, and take great pride and
interest in them, yet will require from them
implicit obedience. With Cautiousness and
Causality large, he will be induced to seek
advice, but only for the purpose of enabling him
to form his own opinion. With Cautiousness
large, he will often appear disconcerted and diffident,
in consequence of his anxiety about
matters likely to affect him. With Firmness,
Secretiveness and Imitation large, a person will
never act in a subordinate station. Let his
situation in life be what it may, he will always
be a leader.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Self-esteem moderate, and
with a favourable developement of other organs,
one will have sufficient self-respect for the ordinary
occupations of life, but he will never be
able to put himself forward in any great undertaking,
or to command that general influence
and esteem as he would do with a larger developement
of this organ. With Cautiousness, Love
of Approbation and Veneration large, he will be
humble, timid and abashed in the presence of
superiors or strangers. He will lack the requisite
independence to vindicate his own opinion,
and will be too ready to give way to that of
others. With this organization, and large Intellect,
he may possess great abilities, but for want
of self-confidence requisite to enable him to
make his way through opposition, he will be
much underrated. It will give him pain to be
obliged to trespass on the attention of others,
and he will suffer greatly from a feeling of unworthiness.
With small Cautiousness, Firmness,
Combativeness and Destructiveness, he
will be enterprising and persevering, yet will
lack that force of character requisite for important
undertakings. With large Veneration,
Conscientiousness and Intellect, he will be
respectful towards others, and will not be deficient
in respect for himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Self-esteem small, one will be
humble and submissive. No matter how exalted
may be the character of his intellect, a feeling
of unworthiness will accompany all his actions.
He will ever associate with inferiors. His language
will be trifling and common-place. Let
his talents be what they may, he will never rise
from an inferior station.</p>

<h3 id="love-of-approbation">3. LOVE OF APPROBATION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ excites the desire of notice, praise,
distinction and recognition. It is an active
element in the mind of the office seeker, the
soldier, the actor, the statesman, &amp;c. It inspires
the fop, and sustains the buffoon. It
causes a desire to be approved as well as noticed,
but it prefers censure to inattention. When
properly regulated, it induces amiability of disposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;An individual with this organ
predominant, will be grossly vain and fantastical.
Every action of his life will be calculated to
excite attention. He will appear to think as
though the world had little else to do than to be
attentive to his actions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With this organ large, a person will
be distinguished for the regard he places upon
his character. The disapprobation of his fellow-men
will be displeasing to him in a high degree.
In his intercourse with society, he will be polite
and courteous, avoiding every thing harsh, austere
or repulsive. If Conscientiousness and
Intellect are deficient, he will be a braggart, and
will often speak of his feats and performances.
If thrown into evil company, he will be foremost
in all deeds of wickedness. With Self-esteem
large, and Causality moderate or small, will be
exceedingly proud and vain, will use much ceremony,
and will be very affected in his manner
and conversation; and if Ideality and Individuality
are large, will be exceedingly fond of dress
and finical decorations. With Adhesiveness
large, and Firmness moderate or small, one will
be influenced by the opinions of his friends and
associates, and will give way to them in opposition
to the dictates of his own judgment.
With this combination, and Destructiveness and
Combativeness large, will get easily offended,
and construe the least inattention from his
friends into dislike or insult. With Cautiousness,
Secretiveness, Veneration and Conscientiousness
large, or very large, and Self-esteem
small, will be very desirous to please, and will
evince great anxiety to carry out this object; will
feel great respect for superiors in age, talents,
&amp;c.; will entertain a feeling of his own inferiority,
and also of reserve, which will have the
effect of making him timid and bashful. With
Combativeness, Destructiveness, Self-esteem,
Firmness, Ideality, Individuality, Eventuality
and Language large, and Comparison and Causality
large, will possess talents for an exalted
order, and an ardent ambition of fame. This
combination will enable him to distinguish himself
for intellectual greatness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With this organ but moderately
developed, a person will by no means be insensible
to the opinions of the world, yet, if Self-esteem
and Conscientiousness are large, he will
not allow its opinions to force him from the path
of duty. If Adhesiveness is large, the opinion
of his friends will have much influence over him.
If Firmness, Self-esteem and Combativeness are
large, he will be austere and independent, doing
what his own feelings dictate, regardless of the
frowns or favours of his fellow-men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Love of Approbation small,
one will almost be insensible to the feelings of
shame, and will be nearly regardless of public
opinion. With small Ideality, he will be slovenly
in his dress and appearance.</p>

<h3 id="cautiousness">4. CAUTIOUSNESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ is the parent of fear. It urges its
possessor to use every precaution possible for his
individual safety. It is excited by every object
that has power to affect his condition, or the
condition of the objects of his other feelings. It
renders one prudent, circumspect and judicious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;When this organ predominates,
the individual will be timid, irresolute
and undecided. He will never by any accident
give way to a flow of ideas. For the most insignificant
undertakings he will prepare with the
greatest precaution, and will never form a connexion
without subjecting it to the most rigorous
examination. If Destructiveness is large, and
Hope not more than moderate, he will be liable
to commit suicide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Cautiousness large, a person
will be habitually careful, cautious and prudent
in all his transactions in life. He will never
take a step without due consideration. If Self-esteem,
Combativeness and Destructiveness are
large, he will be wary and prudent in entering
upon an undertaking, but when he has commenced,
he will prosecute it with great energy
and boldness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With but a moderate developement
of this organ, and with large Hope and
Self-esteem, one will be habitually reckless and
imprudent; but if these organs are small, and
Causality and Comparison large, he will not
lack discretion in ordinary occupations of life,
or in cases where his other organs create a lively
interest. If Acquisitiveness is large, he will be
prudent in business transactions. If the Domestic
Feelings are strong, he will be anxious
respecting the welfare of his family; and if
Love of Approbation is strong, he will be particularly
careful in whatever regards his own
reputation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Cautiousness small, a person
will act according to the dictates of his other
faculties, unrestrained by timidity or fear. He
will be rash, precipitate and perfectly regardless
of the results of his conduct. If with a sanguine
temperament, and Hope moderate or large, his
disposition will be gay and cheerful, and will be
too much engrossed with the present.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="moral-sentiments">MORAL SENTIMENTS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="conscientiousness">1. CONSCIENTIOUSNESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ views all actions in their moral
aspect. It operates as an internal monitor, prescribing
to its possessor the claims of truth and
duty. Its power, however, does not enable it
to decide upon what is abstractly just or unjust.
This is affected by the character of the other
organs with which it is combined. A person
with large conscientiousness, and large Selfish
Propensities, will consider an action just, which
another, with the same amount of Conscientiousness,
and smaller propensities, will consider unjust.
This organ is essential to the formation
of a truly philosophic mind, especially in moral
investigations. It produces the desire of discovering
the tact of recognising it when discovered,
and that perfect reliance on its invincible
supremacy which gives at once dignity and
peace to the mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;When this organ predominates,
the individual looks always and only for
truth, and receives it from whatever source it
comes. He is thus disposed to regulate his
conduct by the wisest sentiments of justice,
which imparts an earnestness, integrity and
directness in his manner, that leaves no room to
doubt of his sincerity. He desires to act justly
from the love of justice, unbiased by fear, interest
or any sinister motive. When the actions
have been contrary to the dictates of this organ,
it produces remorse, repentance, a sense of guilt
and demerit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With this organ large, and the Selfish
Propensities moderate, one will be eminently
just and honest in all his dealings. He can
never be brought to sacrifice duty to expediency.
With large Firmness and Combativeness, he
will be particularly firm, bold and decided on
all questions of moral duty. He will never
shrink from the advocacy of right, or from sustaining
the defenceless from the unjust attacks
of their enemies. If with this combination, Destructiveness
is large, he will be inclined to
severely censure any trickery or dishonesty in
others; and if Causality is not large, he will
consider himself the standard of truth and justice,
by which all others must be judged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With but a moderate developement
of this organ, one will endeavour to act
justly; and if Causality and Comparison are
large, and the Selfish Propensities small, he will
generally do so; but if the Selfish Propensities
are very strong, he will be guided more by considerations
of interest than of duty. If with
this combination, and Adhesiveness large, while
he will take advantage of a stranger in a pecuniary
transaction, no power of circumstances
can induce him to trespass on the rights of a
friend. His compunctions of conscience will
be few and feeble. He will not be scrupulous
about what he requires of others, seeming to
claim as a right, that they should make sacrifices
to his interest and inclination. He will
look more to the effect that actions and opinions
will have upon himself, than upon their moral
character. If Love of Approbation, Secretiveness
and Destructiveness are large, he will be
likely to indulge in harsh, censorious and unjust
remarks upon the character of his neighbours,
while at the same time, if Acquisitiveness is
moderate or small, he will be strictly just in all
his dealings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Conscientiousness small, one
will have few or no compunctions of conscience;
he will be ever ready to justify himself to himself,
have little or no regard for moral principle,
and an imperfect idea of right and wrong in the
abstract. With large Self-esteem, Benevolence,
and Adhesiveness, and with small Acquisitiveness
and Secretiveness, he may be honest and kind-hearted
in his general conduct, but it will be
because he considers it dishonourable and unmanly
to commit a mean action, and because it
pains his Benevolence and Adhesiveness to
injure another. With this combination he will
extol his friends in the highest terms, but if he
gets angry with them, he will traduce and vilify
them, being in both cases regardless of their
true merit. If Love of Approbation is large, he
will adopt every means to please without regard
to justice or propriety.</p>

<h3 id="veneration">2. VENERATION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ produces the sentiment of reverence,
without regarding the character of the
object on which it seeks exercise. By its influence
man adores God, venerates saints, and
respects parents, teachers and superiors in general.
This organ is the source of natural religion,
or that tendency to worship a superior power
which manifests itself in every nation yet discovered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Veneration predominant,
a person if religious, will be extremely
devout, and will experience the most profound
feelings of awe and respect in contemplating the
attributes of the deity. If Marvellousness and
Conscientiousness are large, he will be extremely
susceptible of religious impressions, and will not
fail to become a devout and enthusiastic adherent
of the church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;A person with Veneration large, will
feel profound respect for all persons and objects
that are aged and venerable, or in any way entitled
in his estimation to respect and confidence.
With large Benevolence and Conscientiousness,
he will not only act justly and charitably, but
his actions will be accompanied and sustained
by a feeling of respect and reverence for the
abstract principles of justice and charity, that
cannot be conceived by those who have this
organ small. With large Love of Approbation,
and small Conscientiousness, he will be disposed
to think highly of those who are in high
stations, the rich, the powerful and the grand.
If Combativeness and Destructiveness are large,
and Acquisitiveness small, while he may look
with contempt upon the merely wealthy, he will
feel much respect for the memory and character
of the brave and patriotic. With large Intellect,
the action of this organ will be exerted towards
the character and persons of literary men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With this organ but moderately
developed, the sentiment of respect in general
will have but a limited influence over the character
of the individual. If Conscientiousness
and Marvellousness are large, he will probably
be religious, but he will not be so devout and
enthusiastic in his devotions as many others
with less real piety. If Love of Approbation is
large, he will be exceedingly courteous and
attentive, but his conduct will lack that deference
and respect so necessary to conciliate
esteem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Veneration but small, a person
will be almost wholly destitute of the qualities
ascribed to this organ. He may be religious,
but the act of devotion will be a task to him, and
he will be enabled to conceive those feelings of
solemnity and awe, with which many are exercised.
Children so constituted are disobedient
and inattentive to their parents and teachers.</p>

<h3 id="benevolence">3. BENEVOLENCE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ produces the desire of the happiness
of others, and disposes to compassion and
goodness of heart. It produces liberality of sentiment
towards all mankind, and a disposition
to love them and contribute to their pleasures.
The benevolent man cannot feel happy, as long
as famine, bodily suffering and mental misery
are the bitter portion of his fellow creatures.
He will never complain of the heartlessness or
the ingratitude of others. He is so well aware
of wishing well to others, that he does not doubt
of their good will towards himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With this organ predominant,
one may almost be said to be the victim of his
kindness, good will and sympathy to others. In
his zeal for the welfare of his fellow creatures,
he seldom thinks of himself. In society, he
restrains all his selfish inclinations, for fear of
giving uneasiness to others. He will frequently
meditate upon the miseries of mankind, and
consider the various means of relieving their
wretchedness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Benevolence large, one will
be kind, charitable and forgiving. His whole
demeanour will indicate goodness of disposition.
If Secretiveness is small, he will be especially
liable to imposition, as he will be conscious of
entertaining no designs against others, and will
suspect none against himself. If Adhesiveness
is large, and Acquisitiveness small, he will be
exceedingly liberal and generous. He will find
it difficult to withstand the solicitations of charity,
and will be especially alive to the interests
of his friends. With Acquisitiveness large, he
will be well disposed to charitable objects, but
will seldom ever give to them substantial aid.
He will be more likely to give his time and
advice than money. If, with this combination
large, Love of Approbation be added, it will
greatly aid the effect of Benevolence. With
but moderate Destructiveness, it will be difficult
for him to witness suffering or pain; yet, with
large Destructiveness, when it is necessary,
notwithstanding his general kindness of disposition,
can witness and even inflict pain, and
take pleasure in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Benevolence moderate, one
will be kindly and well disposed towards others,
yet, except on extraordinary occasions, will not
make many sacrifices to their good. If Acquisitiveness
and the Selfish Feelings generally
are large, he will be avaricious and selfish to the
last degree, and yet not be absolutely insensible
to the claims of the unfortunate. If Love of
Approbation is large, he may often give to charitable
purposes, but it will be more for the sake
of having his acts the subject of conversation
than out of good will to the object. If Self-esteem,
Combativeness and Destructiveness are
large, he will be harsh, cruel and severe, and
will be apparently utterly regardless of the feelings
of his fellow men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Benevolence but small, one
will be unfeeling and cruel. If Conscientiousness
is large, he will not trespass on the rights
of others in any particular, but his whole conduct
will exhibit, notwithstanding, a disregard
of all the tender amenities of life, and an almost
utter absence of sympathy and good feeling.</p>

<h3 id="hope">4. HOPE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ induces the mind to contemplate
the future with high anticipations of being able
to realize whatever the other feelings desire.
It thus causes us to be gay and cheerful, and to
preserve the equanimity of our temper amidst
difficulties and misfortune. Those who are
destitute of it are prone to disobedience. Their
ideas of the future are always dark and gloomy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Hope predominant, an
individual is constantly revelling in the bright
prospects of the future. He will be so sanguine
of success, that he will neglect the means by
which success can be attained. He will be
credulous and visionary in all his enterprises
and undertakings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Hope large, one always views
the future with bright anticipations. If Caution
and Causality are large, he will never be carried
away by his expectations, but will pursue generally
a prudent course, and not allow his hopes
to hurry him into imprudent measures. If Combativeness,
Firmness, Self-esteem and Ideality
are large, he will be bold, speculative and enterprising;
and if Caution is small, will be excessively
rash, precipitate and imprudent, often
attempting undertakings which to the less sanguine
appear impossible. With this combination,
he will never be cast down or discouraged;
the vicissitudes of fortune have no power to
repress his energy or restrain his enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Hope moderate, one’s expectations
will be sanguine, but not immoderately
so. If Firmness, Self-esteem, Combativeness
and Destructiveness are large, he will
attempt important undertakings, and count with
much certainty and pleasure their chances of
success. If Cautiousness is large, he will despond
much more than hope, will never attempt
enterprises, unless their chances of success are
almost certain; will expect too little, rather
than too much, and will not be sanguine or cheerful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Hope small, a person will be
constantly low spirited and melancholy. The
brightest prospects can hardly excite his spirits.
He will dwell perpetually upon the dark side of
appearances, and will want enterprise and
spirit.</p>

<h3 id="marvellousness">5. MARVELLOUSNESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ produces credulity of mind. It
predisposes to believe without sufficient testimony,
and delights in contemplating the strange
and wonderful. It has been supposed, that this
organ is given to enable the mind to believe in
those passages in Revelation, in which supernatural
performances are related, and that consequently
it increases the zeal and fervour of
the devout and religious. Its more general
manifestations, are to give a fondness for supernatural
stories, and a love of the strange, the
new and the marvellous, and sometimes leads to
a desire to visit mysterious and unfrequented
countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Marvellousness predominant,
one will be exceedingly credulous and
visionary in all his views. He will readily take
for granted whatever is told him of a wonderful
character. He will disregard simple causes,
and be disposed to account for any thing a little
unusual by a forced and unnatural conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Marvellousness large, and
Veneration large, a person, if religious, will be
eminently devout and superstitious. He will
readily believe in special providences, divine
agency, &amp;c. With large Eventuality and Ideality,
will be passionately fond of reading marvellous
accounts, hair-breadth escapes, &amp;c. With
large Cautiousness, and small Causality, will be
afraid of ghosts, and will profess often to see
apparitions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With but a moderate developement
of this organ, and with large Causality and
Comparison, one will be rather sceptical in his
views, requiring much proof before his assent can
be gained, yet at the same time, will keep his
mind open to conviction, and will be willing to
give subjects a considerate examination. If
Causality is small, he will often adopt principles
upon insufficient grounds; and with Ideality
large, will be exceedingly fond of marvellous
tales, and of fictitious excitement of a mysterious
character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Marvellousness small, one will
be exceedingly incredulous and sceptical. It
will be impossible for him to believe any thing
but what is susceptible of the clearest demonstration.
With Ideality moderate or small, he
will have great aversion to marvellous stories and
fictitious works generally. With Veneration
small, he may be religious, but his mind will be
peculiar. He will not submit to the teaching of
any man, and will form his creed from the results
of his own reading and reflection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="intellectual-sentiments">INTELLECTUAL SENTIMENTS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="ideality">1. IDEALITY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ imparts a relish and a desire for
the beautiful, the elevated and the exquisite. It
renders its possessor constantly alive to impressions
of beauty, and leads to a desire of improvement.
Those who possess it large are never
satisfied with sober reality; but delight to revel
in the illusions of fancied existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Ideality predominant,
one will live in a state of constant illusion. He
will be enthusiastic and chimerical in all his
views and opinions. His enjoyments will be of
the most intense description, and his suffering of
the same character. Plain matter of fact and
sober reality will disgust him. He will be ever
striving after the refined and the ideal. He will
be an enthusiastic admirer of poetry and the fine
arts, and all objects of taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With this organ large, one will possess
a rich and glowing fancy, and a natural
refinement and exquisiteness of taste. With
Benevolence large, he will be much afflicted at
the miseries of mankind, and will long for a
state of existence where happiness is unalloyed
and pleasure interminable. With Adhesiveness
large, his ideas of friendship will be of the most
exquisite and refined description. With Colour,
Form and Size large, he will be an excellent
judge of paintings, and will be exceedingly fond
of them; with Locality and Form large, will take
great delight in picturesque scenery, in flowers,
trees, &amp;c. With large Language and Comparison,
will employ many metaphors and figures
of speech in his writings and conversations;
with Self-esteem and Comparison large, he will
be exceedingly choice in his use of language;
and if, with this combination, Language be large,
and Causality small, he will have many more
words than ideas, and will converse much more
than think. He will be superficial and showy,
rather than solid. With Amativeness and Adhesiveness
large, will be fond of such poetry as
is the subject of love and passion. With Imitation
and Marvellousness large, will never relapse
in his efforts for improvement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Ideality moderate, one
will not be insensible to the beauties of nature
and art, yet will never allow his fancy to obtain
the mastery over him. He will seldom experience
a high degree of enthusiasm and rapture of
feeling, and be rather a plain and matter-of-fact
character. If Causality is large, he may relish
fiction, but it will be more for its sentiment than
for its ideal qualities. If Self-esteem is small,
his language will be exceedingly plain, and he
will never attain a high degree of refinement and
polish of manners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Ideality small, one will be
incapable of appreciating beauty. His views
and sentiments will be coarse and unrefined.
His expressions will be low and vulgar. He
will have great aversion to poetry, paintings and
all works of taste.</p>

<h3 id="constructiveness">2. CONSTRUCTIVENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ furnishes the inclination to construct,
to build, and to invent. It is supposed
by many, that this organ of itself is a proof of
the ability to be an operative mechanic, but this
is an error; the office of the organ is only to
manifest the desire by which the intellect is
excited to its gratification. To possess a high
degree of inventive power, one must not only
possess a large organ of Constructiveness, but a
favourable intellect; and to be a successful practical
mechanic, it is requisite to have along with
these two requisites, a large developement of
Form, Size, Weight, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Constructiveness predominant,
one will possess a high degree of
natural ability for planning, contriving, building,
&amp;c. He will take great delight in contemplating
works of architecture, and other subjects of
human ingenuity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With large Constructiveness and
Imitation, one will excel in making after a pattern;
but if Form, Size and Weight are small,
he will be unable to construct from his own
invention.</p>

<h3 id="imitation">3. IMITATION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> function of this organ is to enable its possessor
to do whatever he has witnessed performed
by others. It leads to a desire to represent,
mimic, act, copy, &amp;c. It greatly facilitates
the learning of a foreign language, and is
an essential ingredient in the character of the
skilful mechanic. The gestures of the active
are prompted by the same feeling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With this organ predominant
will be given to practice mimicry and representation.
If Secretiveness is large, he will be well
calculated for the stage, and can readily represent
any feeling or sentiment that he may be
enabled to conceive. With large Eventuality,
Individuality and Mirthfulness, will readily notice
all the peculiarities of his associates, and be
perpetually turning them into ridicule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With large Love of Approbation,
Ideality, Self-esteem, Individuality and Secretiveness,
one will be able readily to adapt himself
to the customs and forms of any society in
which he may be thrown. With this combination
and tolerably favourable opportunities for
observation, his manners will be highly polished
and agreeable. With large Form, Size and
Ideality, can readily copy or imitate a superscription,
or other writing, and with proper discipline
will excel in drawing. With large Constructiveness,
Form and Size, will be highly
capable of excelling in a mechanical profession.
With large Secretiveness, can relate stories with
great force. With large Secretiveness, Individuality,
Eventuality, Language and Comparison,
he will excel in description, and be capable
of giving force and life to his ideas that will
fasten them upon the recollection of his auditors.
With Secretiveness and Firmness large, can restrain
the expression of pain in the most heroic
manner, and assume the appearance of perfect
health. If Secretiveness is small, he will be
unable to imitate a character, or mimic, yet will
nevertheless be able to draw, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With but a moderate developement
of this organ, one will find great difficulty
in description, imitating, or in any performance
that requires the exercise of this faculty. With
large Secretiveness, he will be enabled to relate
stories, but he can never be able to represent
any continued action, or carry out a successful
description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Imitation small, an individual
will be almost wholly destitute of the attributes
ascribed to this organ. He will be unable to
represent very accurately the simplest actions.
Can never excel in penmanship or drawing, and
will always be distinguished as an original. If
Self-esteem is large, he will dispel ceremony; if
Secretiveness is small, he will be perfectly
unique in his actions, and be distinguished for
his independence and eccentricity.</p>

<h3 id="mirthfulness">4. MIRTHFULNESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ gives the desire and the ability to
enjoy mirth. Its possessors are apt to consider
things in their most humorous light, to the neglect
of their more sober characteristics. It is
that principle of the mind, which enables one to
detect what is absurd and ridiculous, and to
delight in jokes, fun and laughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Mirthfulness predominant,
one has an irresistible tendency to view
every thing in a comical aspect. His most
serious meditations are liable to be interrupted
by mirthful intrusions; and he will indulge
his humorous propensities, regardless of consequences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Mirthfulness large, will have
a lively perception of the ludicrous, and will be
apt to catch up every little incident, and make
it the subject of humorous remarks. With
Destructiveness and Comparison large, he will
be sarcastic, and severe in his jokes, and will
laugh heartily at the discomfiture of others. If
Secretiveness and Imitation are small, he will
not be able to relate a joke with propriety, yet
will enjoy one; but if Secretiveness, Ideality
and Imitation are large, he will tell a story in
the most refined and delightful manner; with
Comparison and Love of Approbation large, and
Causality and Secretiveness moderate, he will
laugh excessively at his own jokes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Mirthfulness moderate,
one is fond of fun, but unable to make it. With
Combativeness, Destructiveness and Comparison
large, will be severe and pungent in his attempts
at wit, and will thus often give offence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Mirthfulness but small, one
will be nearly destitute of the ability to enjoy a
joke, and quite unable to make one. He will
look upon wit as impertinent and silly, and be
offended at jocose remarks. If Love of Approbation
is large, he will be very much annoyed
at jokes; with Combativeness moderate or large,
will get highly offended at any attempts to do
so.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="observing-faculties">OBSERVING FACULTIES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="individuality">1. INDIVIDUALITY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> function of this organ is to recognise
existences, or the identity of substances without
reference to their peculiarities; it has been
termed the memory of things. Its recollective
powers are limited to simple details, or facts
having no reference to their form, colour, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;One in whom Individuality is
predominant, will be distinguished for his powers
of observation. No object will escape his
scrutiny, and no opportunities will satiate his
curiosity. If his reflective powers are weak, he
will require a great mass of facts, but they will
lie in his mind confused and unoccupied: he
will be unable to employ them in illustration or
argument. If in the habit of writing, his compositions
will abound with personifications. If
Causality is large, and Concentrativeness is
small, his reflective powers will be weakened
by the tendency imparted by individuality to
dwell upon substances instead of causes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Individuality large, one is
induced to observe and examine every object
that comes under the limits of his vision.
His scrutiny does not appear to include the
peculiarities of substances, but rests satisfied
with their mere corporeal existence. He is distinguished
as a close observer of men and things.
In description he is exceedingly minute; and
with Concentrativeness large, prolix and tedious
to the last degree. With Eventuality and Time
large, he will not only notice quickly, but will
remember with exactness; and with Language
large, can describe accurately events, manners,
customs, &amp;c. With these organs large, he will
have a great desire for reading, and for collecting
facts. With the Reflective Powers and
Language large, will be much given to reflection,
and in expressing his thoughts will be
clear and perspicuous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Individuality moderate,
and the Reflective Powers and Concentrativeness
large, will be subject to abstraction of mind,
and will be much more given to reflection than
to observation, still, when any thing peculiar is
offered to his attention, he can readily examine
its character. He will generally notice existences
more in relation to their uses and adaptations,
than as mere identities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;A person whose Individuality is
small, is generally heedless and unobserving.
With Locality moderate or small, he may travel
extensively; and yet remain as ignorant as if he
had staid at home. Nothing but the more obvious
characteristics has power to excite his
attention. If Constructiveness and Ideality are
full, he will notice works of architecture, but
his descriptions of such will lack unity in consequence
of his incapacity to notice details. If
Causality and Comparison are large, he will be
addicted to reflection, but his expressions will
be vague and apparently inconsistent, consequent
on his inability to collect minute details.</p>

<h3 id="form">2. FORM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ gives the ability to discriminate
forms. It aids the artist, and a prominent
developement is indispensable to the skilful mechanic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Form predominant, one
never forgets the appearance of any thing that
has once came distinctly under his cognition.
He will readily discriminate the forms of objects
at a distance, and perceive differences and resemblances
where many others will not; can
recollect the name of a person by remembering
its appearance when written; will easily detect
typographical errors; and with Size and Individuality
large, can read with great facility and
correctness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Form large, one much more
readily recollects the appearance of a person
than his name, this is more particularly the case
with Individuality large. With Individuality
small, he will not be apt to pay attention to
ordinary matters, but if his attention is called
to them, he recollects their appearance with
distinctness. With Imitation large, he will be
able to draw and copy with great facility, and
will excel in penmanship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Form moderate, and the
Reflecting organs large, one will never notice
the shapes of substances, until something particular
enforces his attention. He will then
require considerable examination to enable him
to recognise them afterwards. His recollection
of persons and things will usually be confused
and indistinct. With Individuality large, observes
much, and with tolerable distinctness;
but with Individuality small, is heedless and
inattentive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Form small, a person will be
unable to recollect the countenances of persons
even with whom he is intimate. He will be apt to
miscall words in reading. He will find it difficult
to decipher obscure handwriting. It will
also be difficult, if not impossible, for him to
make much progress in the natural sciences.</p>

<h3 id="size">3. SIZE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ gives the idea of space, and the
power of judging the relative dimensions of
objects; it also gives the ability to judge of distances
or of lineal space.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Size predominant, one’s
perceptions of the dimensions of objects will be
singularly accurate, he will be enabled to tell at
a mere glance the dimensions of a room, the
length and relative distances of objects, the
centre of a circle, and to perform any other
action requiring the exercise of this organ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Size large, one will possess all
the attributes ascribed to Size predominant, but
in a minor degree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Size but moderate, and
without having been accustomed to the exercise
of the organ, one will greatly err in judging of
the dimensions of objects and size generally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Size small, one will be signally
deficient in all the qualities ascribed to this
organ.</p>

<h3 id="weight">4. WEIGHT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> office of this organ is to impart to its
possessor the idea of the power of gravity, or of
mechanical force and resistance. It gives great
ability to judge of momentum, and is large in the
heads of all those who excel in fencing, boxing,
archery, skating, quoit playing, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Weight predominant,
one will be remarkable for his power in the use
of this faculty. In performing gymnastic feats,
in balancing, riding a fractious horse, and in
every other exercise that requires a display of
agility he will be pre-eminently conspicuous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Weight and Self-esteem large,
one can easily adapt himself to the laws of
gravity, will never fall in precarious situations,
can go aloft at sea in the most intrepid manner,
and readily perform any operation requiring the
exercise of this endowment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Weight but moderate, one
will be rather deficient in the qualities ascribed
to the functions of this organ, but with practice,
may attain considerable skill and success in the
arts to which it conduces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Weight but small, one will
easily lose his balance, even in situations where
no danger is to be apprehended. He will be
enabled to excel as a marksman or wrestler;
will be enabled to learn to skate, or to pitch
quoits. With large Form, Constructiveness
and Imitation, will have a mechanical turn, but
will be unable to excel as a machinist in consequence
of his inability to perform the functions
ascribed to this organ.</p>

<h3 id="colour">5. COLOUR.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ gives the perception of Colour,
and renders one sensible to their different
shades, their harmony and discord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With this organ predominant,
one will notice the colour of an object before any
other peculiarity appertaining to it; will take
delight in colours, in their arrangement, order
and beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Colour, Ideality and Comparison
large, one will be distinguished for his
love of colours, and his ability to discriminate
and arrange them. With large Form, Ideality,
Individuality, Constructiveness and Imitation,
Size and Order, will excel as a portrait painter,
and take great delight in that occupation; and
with Eventuality, Locality and Comparison, as
an historical painter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Colour but moderate, and
in an occupation that does not exercise the function
of this organ, one will be decidedly deficient
in his ability to discriminate colours, but if his
pursuits are the reverse of what is here presumed,
he will be a tolerable judge of colours, and possess
considerable taste in his arrangement and
selection of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With this organ but small, an individual
will be unable to discriminate any but the
most striking colours. With Ideality large,
may be fond of paintings, but will be unable to
point out their peculiar beauties. He can never
tell the colour of the eyes or hair of even his
familiar acquaintances.</p>

<h3 id="order">6. ORDER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ imparts that quality of mind,
which prompts an individual to preserve order
and arrangement in his several pursuits and occupations.
The peculiar action of the organ is
much dependent upon the character of the other
developements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With this organ predominant,
one will be distinguished for his love of order
and arrangement. His maxim will be “<i>a place
for every thing, and every thing in its place</i>.”
This quality of mind will be a prominent trait
in his character, and will influence to a great
degree his conduct and actions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With this organ large, one will be
much annoyed by disorder; his room, clothes,
books, papers, and every thing under his control,
will always be kept in the utmost neatness and
regularity. With Adhesiveness large, will be
fond of social enjoyments, but his pleasures will
be much interrupted on discovering a want of
neatness and order in the persons of his friends
and acquaintances. With Ideality and Individuality
large, will be exceedingly neat and
fastidious. With Combativeness and Destructiveness
large, will easily get offended and angry
at seeing things out of place. With Locality
large, he will be enabled to perform actions
in places in the dark, with which he is acquainted
almost as well as in the light. With Ideality
but moderate or small, he will be slovenly in his
dress and appearance, yet preserve order, arrangement
and neatness with his books, papers,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Order but moderate, one
will be rather deficient in the qualities ascribed
to this organ. He will be fond of order, and
acknowledge its utility, but will be unable to
observe it. With Ideality large, and having
been educated in habits of order and neatness,
the action of this organ will be much improved.
He will possess most of the qualities ascribed to
Order large, but will never sacrifice much to
this quality of mind; but with Ideality small,
and with an imperfect education, he will be
slovenly, loose and irregular in all his actions
and movements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With this organ small, one will be
exceedingly disorderly and incoherent in all his
arrangements, and business details. His actions
will not be guided by system, his books, papers,
&amp;c. will be left where he happens to use them.
He will be unable to appreciate the utility of
order, and complain of those who practice it as
being over nice.</p>

<h3 id="calculation">7. CALCULATION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ enables us to form the idea of
number, or the plurality of objects. It assists
in the recollection of dates and quantities. It
enables one to readily understand numbers and
their combinations. Its activity takes place,
whenever there is a departure from unity. A
large endowment of this organ is not essential
to the algebraist and geometrician, its functions
being limited to arithmetical calculations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;One having Calculation predominant,
will reckon in his head almost any
arithmetical problem that can be proposed to
him. If Causality and Comparison are large,
he will excel in the higher branches of mathematics,
and possess a great fondness for these
studies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With calculation large, one will be
distinguished among his acquaintances for his
skill in arithmetical calculations. He will be
enabled to tell at a glance, operations which to
an ordinary accountant require the use of figures.
If Causality and Comparison are large, he will
excel in solving difficult problems in the higher
mathematics, but if these organs are deficient,
his talent will be limited to arithmetical calculations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Calculation moderate, and
in a situation which constantly demands the act
of ready calculation, one may become highly
talented in this respect. He will, however,
require time and effort to go through an intricate
operation. If Causality and Comparison
are large, in ordinary circumstances he will
accustom himself to the use of a slate and pencil
for all operations of a complicated character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Calculation small, one can
succeed in arithmetical calculations only by dint
of great labour, and then only to a limited extent.
If Causality and Comparison are large, he may
be capable of the higher branches of mathematics,
but the difficulty, which his arithmetical
calculations cost him, will render him averse to
all mathematical speculations.</p>

<h3 id="locality">8. LOCALITY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ gives the power of noticing and
recollecting the peculiar position of objects, and
gives a desire for travelling, and for the study
of geography. It is essential to the scene
painter. It strongly aids the power of association.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Locality predominant,
one will have an insatiable desire for travelling,
roving about, and for visiting strange places,
will readily recollect their peculiar position, the
localities of the prominent objects of attention,
and will be excessively fond of reading geography
and works of travels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Locality large, one will have
a great desire for travelling; and with Acquisitiveness
and Inhabitiveness moderate or small,
will be prompted to roam about regardless of
expense, or of family considerations. In visiting
strange places, he readily notices their peculiar
localities, and will ever after recollect them.
He will be excessively fond of studying geography,
and works of travels; and will be enabled
to point out the particular position of a
sentence in a book or newspaper containing an
idea to which he wishes to direct attention. He
will never stumble in the dark, and will find his
way with little instruction through unfrequented
places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Locality but moderate,
one will have but little desire for travelling, and
will be nearly regardless of the localities of the
places which he visits. He will often lose his
way in forests and cities, with which he is not
familiar, and will seldom find a place if obscurely
situated without great trouble. With
Individuality and Ideality large, will have a
fine taste for natural scenery, but his descriptions
will be vague and unsatisfactory in consequence
of his inability to point out the particular
localities of the different objects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Locality small, one will be
extremely unobservant of, and inattentive to the
localities of objects. He will often lose his way
even in places with which he is familiar, and
will be nearly wanting in the attributes ascribed
to this organ.</p>

<h3 id="eventuality">9. EVENTUALITY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ takes cognizance of actions as
they exist; and thus observes the phenomena
that is constantly taking place throughout nature.
It is a principal element in the desire for
knowledge, and greatly aids in giving an ability
for practical business involving details.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Eventuality predominant,
one will notice and remember every transaction
and occurrence that comes within his
observation, in all their varied details. He will
have an insatiable thirst for knowledge, and seldom
allow any incident to escape his recollection.
He will attend much more to facts than
to principles, and will be given more to narration
than to reasoning, often weakening his
arguments by narrating unimportant particulars,
which have little connexion with the point contested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;Those in whom this organ is large,
possess a clear and distinct recollection of events
and transactions, and are much given to reading
and observation. They are particularly fond
of historical and other works, abounding in facts
and incidents. With Language large, will be
fond of relating with extreme minuteness, occurrences
and facts with which he is familiar. If
Concentrativeness is large his narrations will be
given in a clear and connected style; but if Concentrativeness
is small, they will want method
and connexion. With large Individuality, Language
and Comparison, he will possess a great
thirst for knowledge, and will readily collect,
analyze and classify ideas. If, with this combination,
Causality being moderate or small, he
will have a large fund of knowledge, but be
unable to profit by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Eventuality moderate, one
will be able usually to observe actions, but will
be inattentive to any but those of the most striking
character. If Causality and Comparison are
large, will possess a ready power of reasoning
and classification, but will be wanting in facts
and details to sustain his own opinions. He
will be more given to reason than narration, and
will collect facts more for the purpose of illustrating
his arguments, than the pleasure of acquiring
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Eventuality small, one will be
decidedly deficient in his recollection of facts
and incidents, and will be dull and incurious. He
will be enabled to follow any occupation requiring
a close attention to details. In narrating,
he will be unable to recollect any but the most
striking points.</p>

<h3 id="time">10. TIME.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ gives the ability to observe and
recollect the lapses of time. It also confers the
power of keeping time in music and dancing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Time predominant, one
will possess an astonishing facility in recollecting
dates, the ages of individuals, time at which
occurrences have taken place, and the lapses of
time generally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Time large, one will readily
recollect the date of transactions that have come
under his attention, will be fond of history, and
will especially recollect the precise time of each
event. He will be enabled to perform an action
at the given word of command. If in the habit
of dancing, will excel, and take great delight in
that amusement. He will be able to judge the
hour of the day, without the aid of a time piece,
with accuracy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Time moderate, one will
recollect none but the most important dates. If
Eventuality is large, will be fond of history,
but will generally forget the time of transactions,
and thus want clearness in his historical knowledge.
He will often forget the day of the week
and even his own age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With this organ small, one will be
nearly deficient in the attributes ascribed to its
functions.</p>

<h3 id="tune">11. TUNE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ gives the taste for music, and
makes its possessor take a high degree of pleasure
in listening to musical performances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With this organ predominant,
one will have an exquisite taste for music,
will make any sacrifices to enjoy the pleasure
it imparts, and will readily catch and learn
tunes almost by intuition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With this organ large, one will have
a superior taste for music, and will easily learn
tunes, and if his voice be good, will easily learn
to sing. If Ideality is large, his performances
will be rich and pathetic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With this organ moderate, one
will possess a considerable taste for music, and
with a good voice and large Imitation, may learn
to sing from hearing others, but can never excel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With this organ small, one may be
fond of music of particular kinds to which he
has been accustomed, but this will not enable
him to learn or practice music.</p>

<h3 id="language">12. LANGUAGE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> function of this organ is to enable its
possessor to express his ideas in appropriate language,
and thus to communicate thoughts and
sentiments. The talent of verbal memory depends
on this organ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;Those in whom this organ
predominates abound with words. They talk
merely for the sake of talking, and their style
in writing and speaking is characterized by great
verbosity. In ordinary conversation they will use
a great multitude of words to express a common
idea, and will be distinguished among their acquaintance
as intolerable talkers. They will
be able to commit words to memory with readiness,
and will recollect forms of expression,
where otherwise the idea would escape them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Language large, one will possess
the qualities to a great extent that are
ascribed to Language predominant. With large
Individuality, Form, Locality and Eventuality,
will be enabled to relate with great accuracy
the conversation of a speaker, his looks, tones
and actions, and will readily recall the precise
words used. He will possess great ability to
acquire knowledge, and will be distinguished
for copiousness, ease and volubility of expression.
If Causality and Comparison are moderate
or small, his ideas will be of a crude,
imperfect character, yet he will converse incessantly
nevertheless. With Comparison large,
his knowledge of language will be superior, but
if Comparison is small his words will often be
incorrect and applied in a wrong sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Language but moderate on
ordinary occasions, one will be wanting in
powers of expression, and to express his ideas
with fluency and effect, he will require much
excitement. If Causality and Comparison are
large, with a large and active brain, he will
have many important ideas, but they will lose
much of their cogency for want of more appropriate
expressions. With Secretiveness large,
he will be rather taciturn and indisposed for
conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Language small, one will be
unable to express any but the most common
ideas without hesitation and embarrassment.
He will find it difficult and almost impossible to
commit to memory, and his style of speaking
and writing will be dry and common place; talking
will be to him a burthen.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="reflective-faculties">REFLECTIVE FACULTIES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="causality">1. CAUSALITY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> organ observes the relation of cause and
effect, and discriminates between actions and
the causes which produce them. It enables an
individual to adopt the requisite means to effect
any end. It is the active element in every effort
of reflection, and is the grand source of thought
and originality of mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Causality predominant,
an individual will be distinguished for his proneness
to thought, and utility to speculate and discuss
abstractions. Whatever subject is suggested,
or point discussed, he will be liable to enquire
for reasons and causes. He will be given much
more to reflection than observation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Causality large, one will be
enabled readily to perceive the relation between
an effect and the cause which produced it. He
will be distinguished for gravity and thoughtfulness
of mind; and will possess much sagacity,
penetration, and originality. With Conscientiousness,
Veneration and Marvellousness large,
and the selfish propensities moderate or small,
he will be much given to moral investigations,
and to reading and conversing upon subjects
connected with general utility and public morals.
With Combativeness large, he will be inclined
to argument and disputation. With the Perceptive
organs but moderate, he will pay more attention
to principles than facts, and will be
guided more by reason and experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Causality moderate, and
with proper culture, one may possess good judgment
and a reasoning turn of mind, but he will
be destitute of originality and force of thought.
In an occupation or course of life to which he
has been accustomed, he will conduct with prudence
and propriety, but will be deficient in the
necessary power to devise means for extraordinary
operations, lay new plans, and to carry into
effect important operations. With large Individuality,
Imitation and Love of Approbation,
and small Self-esteem, he will be destitute of
any marked characteristics of his own, and will
readily adapt himself to the views and opinions
of his companions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;With Causality small, one will be
utterly deficient in originality and force of mind,
and will be wanting in that quality of character
which renders men calm, judicious, penetrating
and discerning. With the propensities and sentiments
properly balanced, he will possess discretion,
and be enabled to conduct operations to
which he has been accustomed.</p>

<h3 id="comparison">2. COMPARISON.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> office of this organ is to enable us to compare
differences, to note resemblances, and to
perceive analogies. By it we are enabled to
adapt one thing to another so as to produce a
harmonious whole. It prompts to the use of
figurative language in writing and conversation.
Those in whom it is large, trace similitudes
and affinities between objects and events which
entirely escape the observation of others in
whom the organ is small. It prompts to reasoning,
but not in the line of necessary consequence.
It explains one thing by comparing it with another.
It gives ingenuity in discovering unexpected
glimpses and superficial coincidences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Predominant.</span>&mdash;With Comparison predominant,
one will be enabled to analyze subjects,
and to detect inconsistencies with the greatest
facility and readiness, and will almost intuitively
perceive the misapplication of facts and principles.
His expressions will be characterized by
great precision and clearness, and his arguments
will be explained with a great variety of happy
illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;With Comparison large, one will be
strongly given to criticising and analyzing, and
will readily detect fallacies and improprieties
that would escape the observation of those in
whom this organ is small. If Ideality and Individuality
are large, his language will abound
with elevated metaphors and figures of speech,
but if Causality is small, his judgment will be
defective. If Secretiveness is small, and Combativeness
and Self-esteem large, he will be
strongly inclined to criticise every observation
he hears, and will thus excite enmity and ill-will.
With large Eventuality and Individuality,
will have a great taste for the study of natural
science, and will be extremely fond of
classifying their phenomena, and of comparing
the various qualities of physical objects with
each. He will likewise be fond of the study of
history, and will habitually compare and classify
the various transactions with those of similar
characteristics. If the Perceptive organs generally
are large and Causality small, he will be
possessed of good practical talents, but will be
devoid of originality of mind. He will be calculated
to succeed in a course of life in which he
has the example of able men, but he will be
utterly unable to deviate from the beaten road
and assume the lead for himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;With Comparison but moderate,
one’s powers of analyzation and criticism will
not be conspicuous. With an active brain and
a favourable intellect generally, he will be enabled
to perceive the force of figurative language,
and will often indulge in it, but his metaphors
will lack force and appropriateness. With Individuality
and Eventuality large, will possess
a great store of facts, but will be unable to
arrange and classify them. If Causality is large,
he will readily perceive the errors in an argument,
but he will lack the power to point out
and apply the exact replication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;One having Comparison small, will
be excessively dull, and will lack discernment
and discrimination. The most obvious resemblances
can hardly be made manifest to him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="temperaments">TEMPERAMENTS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> term Temperament, says a late writer,
is applied to those differences of external appearance
which are supposed to indicate the comparative
state of the fibres of the body as they
are more or less dense, or as possessing one of
the functions of life in greater activity, or one
of the constituents of the animal body in greater
quantity than another; or in short, certain states
or conditions of the body, which are found to
exercise more or less influence in exciting or
repressing the action of the organs.</p>

<p>The Temperaments as they are usually enumerated,
are four in number, to wit: the Lymphatic;
the Sanguine; the Bilious; and the
Nervous.</p>

<p>In persons of a Lymphatic Temperament, the
brain is sluggish and performs its functions in a
feeble but steady manner. The individual is
averse to severe exertion, and requires much
stimuli to move him. As a general rule, he
will be averse to either mental or bodily activity.</p>

<p>Those of a Sanguine Temperament are easily
excited, and easily depressed, fond of pleasure,
and averse to severe exertions. They live for
the present, rather than the future. The actions
of the mind are quick, rather than powerful.</p>

<p>Persons of a Bilious Temperament are determined,
persevering and ambitious in their character
and disposition. Their every movement
and aspect indicates decision of purpose. Their
mental operations are vigorous and powerful.</p>

<p>Persons of a Nervous Temperament, are very
sensitive, and are easily excited. Their mental
operations are rapid, but they are soon exhausted.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
